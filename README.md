This is a full stack food ordering app built with Nuxt 3.
I used authentication and authorization with Nuxt-Auth and Stripe for payments.
I used Prisma for the database and Postgres for the database.
I used Tailwind CSS for the styling.
I used Typescript for the typing saftey.

## Setup

```bash
# npm
npm install

### for the database I used docker compose so you can run the following command:

1- to run the database

docker compose --env-file ./.env up

2- to stop the database

```bash
docker compose down
```

You can find the environment variables examples in the .env.example file.
